            "Yes...it is true, I have started playing NMS once again! but I can explain...ok maybe I can't. BUUUT there was a cool expedition called Remnant that just came out which has so many exciting features that were implemented into the game! I mean how could I resist such an exciting new expedition and new toys to play with!!",
            "I have been playing this game since this Friday and it never seeks to dissapoint! New customizations to your exocraft, a new expedition where you get to roam around with friends on a planet, and new points of interest to explore! I think one of my favorite additions with the new exavator tool that they added for the exocraft. Everytime you ram into a plant or rock you gain a bit of resources from it!",
            "OH and how could I not forget about the anti-gravity gun that they added! YES a gun that defies the laws of physics!! What more could you ask for! (Ok I'm still asking for a lot, but we will express those thoughts for another time). I am honestly amazed by how much Hello Games are continuously investing into this game. It just makes me more hyped for what <strong>Light No Fire</strong> will bring to the table!",
            "I have been amazed by the amount of content that a company is able to pull out each year for the community, it's honestly a breath of fresh air knowing that there IS a company that cares more about the customers enjoyment than making a quick buck like all of those greedy companies out there. AKA (<strong> EA, Ubisoft, Activision, Bethesda</strong>).",
            "If there is one thing that I also say and was taught back at school is that <strong> the customer is always right </strong>. And Hello Games by far has been proving that.",
            "Honestly way to go! Now as you can excuse me, I have some NM/CHORES to do!!"

            "My goal is to publish weekly articles, or at least be consistent with article writing. I always want to give updates on what I am doing. And this will give me the chance to do so. I genuinely love writing what I've been up to. And this can be a great opportunity to express every project i've worked on deeply.",
            "The intentions are simple, write an article that relates to a project i've worked on. Or write an article that relates to technology that I enjoy playing around with. I can also see myself expressing in my articles current issues as well. But I'm going to make sure that any political topics are not being expressed completely.",
            "This is the starting point to officiall writing articles, I can't wait to share my experiences here in the Netherlands deeply. I think some of my future articles will most likely be around that."
