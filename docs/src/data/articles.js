            "My goal is to publish weekly articles, or at least be consistent with article writing. I always want to give updates on what I am doing. And this will give me the chance to do so. I genuinely love writing what I've been up to. And this can be a great opportunity to express every project i've worked on deeply.",
            "The intentions are simple, write an article that relates to a project i've worked on. Or write an article that relates to technology that I enjoy playing around with. I can also see myself expressing in my articles current issues as well. But I'm going to make sure that any political topics are not being expressed completely.",
