        "This week I focused heavily on improving the Updates page layout. As you can see I have established 3 seperate sections in where updates will be presented to a user. The Latest Updates section will contain the latest update that I have posted recently. Recent Updates will showcase at least 3-4 updates that I posted 1-3 weeks ago. And then there is Archived where it will store old updates that I have posted.",
        "I added horizontal scrolling for recent updates, which makes the UI feel much more breathable. This allows the user to see my past updates easily with no issues. This scrolling also applies to the archived section.",
        "I also added multi-paragraph support, and I also added the read more button that allows the user to read more or read less on the screen. This functionality is the starting point to continuous updates on what I've been working on. I can't wait to share more updates throughout the coming weeks. I still have a lot more to do with this website."

I'm also going to see if this static website can have different domain names to since it only correlates to my github name and io format of github. I'm already intrigued by what I can offer through github pages. Anyways small progress today finally, tomorrow I'll see if I can stylize the front page.",
