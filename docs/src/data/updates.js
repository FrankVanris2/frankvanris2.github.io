            "The following days have been very productive on my side. A lot of the tasks I am doing at my current company Intouch365 have been very beneficial in my learning and my growth in product development. Establishing features within an mvp and showcasing those features to my colleagues has allowed me to learn and garner more knowledge/skills. I've learned to adapt and understand the difference between a business perspective and developer perspective. Both have their own sets of challenges, but making them work together has been very educational.", 
            "I've also had the time to really progress on my studies for my second certification. I plan on doing the exam on the 25th of February or close to that date specifically. I'm currently doing a lot of personal study and also doing a lot of practice exams in order to fully understand the scope of the exam. After I complete this exam, I will have one final certificate to accomplish. I am very excited for the benefits that will come after completing all certificates.",
            "As for personal growth, I want to look to other projects that I plan to do after I have more freetime. I'm currenty going to be putting most of my energy right now in studying, but afterwards I plan to go back into doing personal projects. I have one in mind that I really think could allow me to make some income if I were to sell it properly. I just suck at advertising so I will have to look into ways in properly advertising my ideas if my project comes to frutition.",
            "Any who thats all the updates for this week on my side. Making good progress so far with my company, but I still need to keep pushing to become a better developer day by day."

            "This week has been a very busy week, but I can officially state that I am completely done with the mvp of this website. I have completed all of the features that I wanted to implement for this website, and I can safely move on to my next projects. However, I will need to slow down a bit due to the upcoming assignments that I will need to do at Intouch365.",
            "This week for this website I have finally added article functionality, the Contacts page, some more updates to the Experience page to make it more aesthetic to the other pages, and I also added a little easter egg for people to find.",
            "I have to admit things might be slow for the next couple of days due to the fact that I am currently studying for a second certificate. The exam for the certificate will be on February 25th so I really need to put a lot of time and effort into it. So working on projects will be delayed for a bit till I've accomplished the exam.",
            "I also have 2 projects that I am currently pursuing here at Intouch365, one is [REDACTED] and the other is [REDACTED] I wish I could speak more about them but I know once they are completed I can greatly express such achievements for both!",
            "I also plan to really master a programming language. I am not much of a javascript enjoyer however, I have to admit I did use gpt near the end of the project just to complete this as soon as possible. But I ensured that each of the necessary components implemented were similar to how I Implemented it myself.",
            "I plan to give more updates in the coming weeks. And as for Articles, I plan to do write in the next coming months on a project. Stay tuned..."

        "This week I focused heavily on improving the Updates page layout. As you can see I have established 3 seperate sections in where updates will be presented to a user. The Latest Updates section will contain the latest update that I have posted recently. Recent Updates will showcase at least 3-4 updates that I posted 1-3 weeks ago. And then there is Archived where it will store old updates that I have posted.",
        "I added horizontal scrolling for recent updates, which makes the UI feel much more breathable. This allows the user to see my past updates easily with no issues. This scrolling also applies to the archived section.",
        "I also added multi-paragraph support, and I also added the read more button that allows the user to read more or read less on the screen. This functionality is the starting point to continuous updates on what I've been working on. I can't wait to share more updates throughout the coming weeks. I still have a lot more to do with this website."

I'm also going to see if this static website can have different domain names to since it only correlates to my github name and io format of github. I'm already intrigued by what I can offer through github pages. Anyways small progress today finally, tomorrow I'll see if I can stylize the front page.",
             "(AGAIN) I am not really a front end person so don't expect any crazy fancy stuff. I will most likely ask gpt to make things stylish while I focus more on the mechanics of this website."
