            "Howdy yall! Man a week has just passed and I really don't have to many updates to share. I am still working on a project within my company that I plan to finish up by the end of the month. And I can finally share a little bit of my new side project that I am doing.",
            "With my project in my company I've been doing a lot of work around low-code website design and development. I have been learning a lot more about Power Apps, and Dataverse just to get a better grasp on what I'm supposed to be doing. I'm also playing a lot with Power Pages as well! Just today I finished up a cloud flow that was needed in order to notify us if a Case has been created. There are so many exciting things I would like to talk about with this project but I have to keep the rest of those features on the low for now. Let's just say the Supportal is going to look 10 times better than it was before.", 
            "As for my side project, again I can't really speak to much about it but I can say that it's been a little side project that I've wanted to do for a while. And since it's really in the early phases, the only thing I will share today is a photo with this update. The tech stack for this upcoming project is completely all in C++. And the maze you are seeing is completely generated through recursive backtracking.", 
            "Like I said I won't speak more until I have done more work on it. For the next couple of weeks I won't share to much on it, so dont expect a lot of exciting news to occur.", 
            "Now as for the <strong>articles</strong>... I haven't been working on any yet. But I already have one in mind that I want to write about. I know I said I would be posting an article each week, but it has been really tough to do so. I think the best alternative is for me to post them when I can, since right now my headspace doesn't entirely know what I should be writing for my first article. But I will figure out what it should be! I promise.",
            "Anyways those are all the updates for this week, I hope to come back with a bang when ready. For now I'll just be working on my projects and of course doing my weekly updates."

            "Just recently I've been tasked to work on a application within my company that will need continuous maintenance for the years to come. And I am currently developing the necessary pipelines and features for such a application to keep running for a very long time. It's also such a new application to me that I have to learn eeeverything about power pages, and power apps within a months time! Who knew things could get so spicy within the first 3 days of Febraury!",
            "Aside from work, I have one personal project that I am currently working on. It's private though, so I won't be talking to much about it. Buut...there is by chance a repository laying around that could give you some hints into what I am doing wink wink ;)",
            "Other than that, I plan to continue writing articles and updates on my website consistently till I Die!!!! I'm deadass being serious, also don't expect me to make these updates 'professional'. This is after all; my website so I can do whatever the {Redacted} I want!",

            "After weeks of development, I am thrilled to announce my current final addition to this website. Over these past couple of weeks I've been off and on but still having the urge to make a website about myself.",
            "It has been a <strong>long journey</strong> but a <strong>fruitful one</strong> for sure. I always told myself I was going to get to this project of mine, but of course I procrastinated. Now after all this time, I <strong>finally got to finishing my personal website</strong>. I am very proud of the end result, and I hope you all enjoy it as well.",
            "This website will show <strong>updates on my other personal projects, articles that I write, and much more</strong>. I plan to keep this website updated as much as possible, so stay tuned for more blogs in the future!",
            "So what are the final additions that I added? Here is a quick list:",
            "",
            "- <strong>Removed the Contacts page, and added contact icons to the navbar instead.</strong>",
            "- <strong>Renamed Updates & Artciles to Blogs.</strong>",
            "- <strong>Made the Pong Game a bit easier to beat, I can deny nor confirm what lies at the end of the game (Still a Secret).</strong>",
            "- <strong>Added my Work Eligibility badge to the homepage.</strong>",
            "- <strong>Added minor mobile support.</strong>",
            "",
            "If your asking where the mobile phone support is well...I added a bit just to make it a bit more friendly. But I probably won't touch up on it more.",

            "The following days have been very productive on my side. A lot of the tasks I am doing at my current company Intouch365 have been very beneficial in my learning and my growth in product development. Establishing features within an mvp and showcasing those features to my colleagues has allowed me to learn and garner more knowledge/skills. I've learned to adapt and understand the difference between a business perspective and developer perspective. Both have their own sets of challenges, but making them work together has been very educational.", 
            "I've also had the time to really progress on my studies for my second certification. I plan on doing the exam on the 25th of February or close to that date specifically. I'm currently doing a lot of personal study and also doing a lot of practice exams in order to fully understand the scope of the exam. After I complete this exam, I will have one final certificate to accomplish. I am very excited for the benefits that will come after completing all certificates.",
            "As for personal growth, I want to look to other projects that I plan to do after I have more freetime. I'm currenty going to be putting most of my energy right now in studying, but afterwards I plan to go back into doing personal projects. I have one in mind that I really think could allow me to make some income if I were to sell it properly. I just suck at advertising so I will have to look into ways in properly advertising my ideas if my project comes to frutition.",
            "Any who thats all the updates for this week on my side. Making good progress so far with my company, but I still need to keep pushing to become a better developer day by day."

I have completed all of the features that I wanted to implement for this website, and I can safely move on to my next projects. However, I will need to slow down a bit due to the upcoming assignments that I will need to do at Intouch365.",

            "I have to admit things might be slow for the next couple of days due to the fact that I am currently studying for a second certificate. The exam for the certificate will be on February 25th so I really need to put a lot of time and effort into it. So working on projects will be delayed for a bit till I've accomplished the exam.",
            "I also have 2 projects that I am currently pursuing here at Intouch365, one is [REDACTED] and the other is [REDACTED] I wish I could speak more about them but I know once they are completed I can greatly express such achievements for both!",
            "I also plan to really master a programming language. I am not much of a javascript enjoyer however, I have to admit I did use gpt near the end of the project just to complete this as soon as possible. But I ensured that each of the necessary components implemented were similar to how I Implemented it myself.",
            "I plan to give more updates in the coming weeks. And as for Articles, I plan to do write in the next coming months on a project. Stay tuned..."

The Latest Updates section will contain the latest update that I have posted recently. Recent Updates will showcase at least 3-4 updates that I posted 1-3 weeks ago. And then there is Archived where it will store old updates that I have posted.",
        "I added horizontal scrolling for recent updates, which makes the UI feel much more breathable. This allows the user to see my past updates easily with no issues. This scrolling also applies to the archived section.",
        "I also added multi-paragraph support, and I also added the read more button that allows the user to read more or read less on the screen. This functionality is the starting point to continuous updates on what I've been working on. I can't wait to share more updates throughout the coming weeks. I still have a lot more to do with this website."

I'm also going to see if this static website can have different domain names to since it only correlates to my github name and io format of github. I'm already intrigued by what I can offer through github pages. Anyways small progress today finally, tomorrow I'll see if I can stylize the front page.",
