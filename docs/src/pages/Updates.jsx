            <p>This page is where I will posting weekly updates on the things I have been doing for the past couple of days in a week. There will be nothing grand for now,
                especially how bland this page is at the moment. But later on you will see updates on what life has been like in the Netherlands.

                Today I have been working on some work related projects [CLASSIFIED] and some personal projects regarding my website.

            <h2>Update 2 -- 23/12/2025</h2>
            <p> Today I am still working on my website I migrated my current setup to React Vite, since it is a lot more modern. Compared to regular
                React App. So I made the shift so that I can develop in a faster and more clean environment.
