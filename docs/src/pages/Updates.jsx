            <h1>Weekly Updates</h1>
            <p>This page is where I will posting weekly updates on the things I have been doing for the past couple of days in a week. There will be nothing grand for now,
                especially how bland this page is at the moment. But later on you will see updates on what life has been like in the Netherlands.
            </p>
            <h2>Update 1 -- 17/12/2025</h2>
            <p>Currently I've been working on several projects ranging from work to personal. Along with extra curricular projects, 
                Today I have been working on some work related projects [CLASSIFIED] and some personal projects regarding my website.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>Update 2 -- 23/12/2025</h2>
            <p> Today I am still working on my website I migrated my current setup to React Vite, since it is a lot more modern. Compared to regular
                React App. So I made the shift so that I can develop in a faster and more clean environment.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>Update 3 -- 29/12/2025</h2>
            <p> Today I finally was able to publish my website successfully within Github Pages. Now everything is working as intended. That was the plan,
                Overall I've been quite lazy, but I plan to make decent progress on my website bit by bit. I can see myself progressing a bunch within certain
                areas of my website. Especially future projects, personal blog updates, and much more. I'm also going to see if this static website can have 
                different domain names to since it only correlates to my github name and io format of github. I'm already intrigued by what I can offer through
                github pages. Anyways small progress today finally, tomorrow I'll see if I can stylize the front page. (AGAIN) I am not really a front end person
                so don't expect any crazy fancy stuff. I will most likely ask gpt to make things stylish while I focus more on the mechanics of this website.S
