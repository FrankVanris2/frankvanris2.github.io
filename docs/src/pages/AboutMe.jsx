            <p>Welcome to the About Me Page where I will be talking about myself and stuff. Honestly this is going to be empty for a while.
                I seriously need to know what I can talk about. In some cases I feel like I have nothing interesting to say about myself.
                But hey, thats just me being me. So yeah, stay tuned for more updates on this page.
