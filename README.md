If you are reading this, I have successfully survived my first encounter with GitHub Pages and DNS records. The website is no longer a dream—it is officially a reality at **[frankcvanris.com](https://www.frankcvanris.com/)**.

**Current Status:** * ✅ Custom Domain configured (Cloudflare + GitHub Pages).

* ✅ High-tech neon favicon generated (FCR).
* ✅ React skills... still being fueled by fermented grape juice.

### 🤖 The Mission

I recently wrapped up my Capstone project and transitioned into the professional world as a full-time developer. While I’m getting paid to code now, this site is my playground.

I’ll be honest: my heart belongs to **Robotics**. I care more about sensors and logic than CSS padding. If the site looks a little "bare metal," it’s because I’m likely busy building a robot in the garage.

### 🍷 The Workflow

My development process is simple:

1. Open VS Code.
2. Open a bottle of wine.
3. Code until the UI looks decent or I forget how `useEffect` works.

**Progress Report:** I have already finished one bottle of wine. The website is live. Coincidence? I think not.

### 🛠 What’s Next?
* **Weeky Updates:** I will post weekly updates and once in a while articles about projects that I will be working on
* **Mobile Compatibility:** Right now, the site looks best on a monitor. Eventually, I’ll make it look good on your phone, but for now, just look at it on a laptop. (FAR IN THE FUTURE)
