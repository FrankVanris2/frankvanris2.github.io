### What this website will be about
This website will be about me and everything I have done as a Student and Developer. This is also the first time I've done Github pages, so all of this is quite new to me.
I just finished my Capstone project last year with my team and I am now officially working full-time with a company. I am now making this project a side project till I continue 
working on some more robotics.

### What to expect
You will expect to see a slow transition from this markdown file to a full fledge website. I absolutely do not have that much React experience, If you give me a bottle of wine 
though I'll definitely get something done, but I will not remember how I did it. But Throughout my time working on my personal website you'll definitely see progress. I want 
to make it very clear though that I am focusing a bunch more on robotics than website design so...sorry if things don't look clean.

Personal Note: I drank already 1 bottle of wine
