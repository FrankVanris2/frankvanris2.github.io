            <p>This is the Projects page! Where I will be showcasing my various projects and their details! 
                Honestly I really hope I can keep doing projects on my own free time. It is something that I really enjoyed doing.
                Currently I'm working a bunch and settling myself here in the Netherlands. But I really see myself doing a lot more
                projects in the near future. ESPECIALLY me finally making myself a following robot. I seriously want a walking or 
                driving R2D2 behind me following me everywhere I go.
