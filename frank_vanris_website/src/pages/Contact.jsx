                This is the contact page for all of the information in how you can contact me. In all honesty I have moved to the Netherlands, so if you are located in the United States, it's going to be a bit difficult for you to 
                contact me. Not only that but I now have a dutch number. I still have my American number, but I sincerily prefer you to use my dutch number if you wish to call me.
            </p>

export default Contact;
