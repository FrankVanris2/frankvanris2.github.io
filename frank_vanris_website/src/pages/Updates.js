            <p>This page is where I will posting weekly updates on the things I have been doing for the past couple of days in a week. There will be nothing grand for now,
                especially how bland this page is at the moment. But later on you will see updates on what life has been like in the Netherlands.

            <h2>Update 1 -- 17/12/2025</h2>
            <p>Currently I've been working on several projects ranging from work to personal. Along with extra curricular projects, 
                Today I have been working on some work related projects [CLASSIFIED] and some personal projects regarding my website.
